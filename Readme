Multi-Agent Debate DAG using LangGraph
ATG Technical Assignment — Machine Learning Intern Deliverable

This project implements a CLI-based multi-agent debate system using LangGraph, simulating a structured argument between two AI personas (e.g., Scientist vs Philosopher) over a fixed user-provided topic. The debate is orchestrated as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), managing turn-taking, memory control, and final evaluation by a judging node.

🚀 Features
Two AI agents engage in 8-round structured debate (4 turns each).

Topic input via CLI from user.

MemoryNode stores contextual memory (not shared across agents).

JudgeNode summarizes debate and declares a winner with rationale.

All transitions and messages logged to file.

DAG visualized using Graphviz or LangGraph visualization tools.

🧩 DAG Node Structure
📥 UserInputNode
Accepts the debate topic from user via CLI.

🧑‍🔬 AgentA (e.g., Scientist)
Takes alternate turns to present arguments.

Receives contextual memory but no shared transcript.

🧠 MemoryNode
Maintains and updates structured debate memory.

Ensures agents only access relevant memory (not each other's arguments).

🧙 AgentB (e.g., Philosopher)
Opponent persona with alternate viewpoints.

Responds and builds upon AgentA’s arguments logically.

⚖️ JudgeNode
Reviews debate flow, argument memory.

Generates:

Complete summary

Declares winner

Justifies decision logically
